### My Personal Portfolio

This was one of my wishes since I started my journey earlier this year. I wanted to have something mine where I could expose all of my projects to everyone, talking a bit about me and about all of my projects. For that I just used **Gatsby** based on **React** to create a static website that could be faster and with all of my own information. My last learning was **Typescript** so I thought that this project could be a good idea to implement it as well, so it is strongly typed with a lot of help from **IDE** based on the types that **Typescript** and I inferred.

With this way I could write **Markdowns** and everytime that I need to add a new project here, I just only need to write a new Markdown and **Gatsby** will do the magic behind the scenes and will bundle everything up into static files, ready to be re-deployed into the server.
