### TicTacToe Game

This website was a case of study, was my very first finished project with JavaSript but this one, I wanted to use only old methods to bult it. I used **ES5 JavaScript** syntax and I structured all the game without **flexbox** or **grid**. The challenge here was to made everything supported for phone and desktop due to my first implementation. I used positioning to made everything and because of that, all of the media queries was made with positioning as well.
