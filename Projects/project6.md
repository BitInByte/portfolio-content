A completely new design of my **portfolio**.

My intention was to build a website which can have different **animations** making it **interactive** and fun to visit.

Also, it is entirely built with **Vue** which is a hot and on demand technology.

It also has all of **my information** and the **technologies** and **stack** that I use as well as the **projects** that I have been building so far.
