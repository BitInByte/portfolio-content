### App Management

The **biggest** project I've ever made.

This project was implemented from scratch. I've started creating some **diagrams** and designing what the app should look like.
I've used **React** for this project since it's quite big and reactive and **firebase** to develop the backend side.
To design it and give it some life, I've used the processor **SASS** with the help of **react modules** and **react-spring** to give it some animation.
I've also used **formik** to create the auth forms such that the login and the register form and **yup** to create some validations, all the other forms such that the form to create a new ToDo, or to create a new project I've just made by and creating a function to create some validation and custom inputs developed without packages.
To protect the props and to get some help from the IDE, I've used the **Prop-types** where I could specify what type of each prop was and if was required or not.
To give it an aspect of multiple pages I've also used **React-router** to give some routes allowing change pages in a single application page.

That's it... It was so much fun but at the same time some struggling at some point.
