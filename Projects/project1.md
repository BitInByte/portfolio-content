### Binary Clock

This project was the introduction of **nodeJs** and some tools provided by it.

This project was developed with **SASS**, a pre-processor for **CSS** that helps us structuring the code and nesting selectors inside of each other, and some other tools that **nodeJs** provide us to minify the code and auto prefixing the code. In this code, I already used some new **ES6** features like **arrow functions** and **const** and **let** variable keywords which changed some behaviours regarding the scopes. Nothing big deal for a project but with introduction on new features and tools.
