## About Me

Hello, nice to meet you üëãüèΩ!

I'm Jo√£o Pedro and I'm actually living in the UK.

I am a **software developer** student and a self-taught **full-stack** **web developer** and **mobile developer** with a big passion on learning new stuff!

My main focus in on working with **strongly typed** and fully **OOP** technologies such as **flutter**, **Angular** and **Spring Boot** but I can also work with **functional programming** technologies such as **react**, **VueJS** and **express.js**.

I am currently **studying software development** in **Anglia Ruskin University** where I am in the last year of the course.
