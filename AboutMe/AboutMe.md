Hello, nice to meet you!

I'm <Marker>João Pedro</Marker> and I'm a developer from Portugal with a big passion on learning new stuff!

Since young that I’ve found myself searching about computers and technology.

I got my first computer when I was 10 years old and the **magic** of the **mouse click** on a **button** to trigger an action **fascinated me**. The “magic” behind the scenes was so fascinating that I knew that I got the necessity of discover why and how those magics happens. I was always super curious regarding to what technology is and what technology can offer to us, humans.
My first programming approach was when I was 15 years old and the language was **Pascal**, before my second College Degree I looked for some tutorials over the internet to create some app and I ended creating a small calculator in Pascal.

I decided to learn as much as I can. I’m already with a couple of courses, from school, Udemy and also from some books and tutorial videos, and now I’m **currently** on the **university** getting a **degree on software engineer** on the 2nd year.

Last year was the year that I decided to take all of my free time off, to **improve** myself as a **programmer** and to explore more deeper some technologies and languages. I wanted to become a cleaner programmer with much more knowledge than I had and I started to put more effort on studies and I’ve just left games, travels and friends aside to **focus only on the studies**.

I got some knowledge from school courses on **Hardware**, **Web Development** and some **Network** as well and on this last year, on my free time, I've just completed a bunch of Udemy courses about **Javascript**, **React** and recently on **Typescript** and **Firebase**. From school, on college, I learned the basics of everything like **HTML**, **CSS**, **PHP** and **SQL**. From my university, we're working a lot with **Java** and **Python**.
